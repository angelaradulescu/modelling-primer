# Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): MOAT model

Part 1 laid out the basic tools for comparing models using MLE. The goal of Part 2 is to use 
those tools to formulate a model comparison that lets you test a hypothesis that you find interesting, and which can be tested with the MOAT data. We will use the MOAT paper draft as a reference throughout. 
The best way to work through Part 2 is to think about the prompts first, and sparingly use the paper as reference if you get stuck. 

## Formulating a hypothesis

Every model comparison begins with a good, clear hypothesis. Recall the first iteration of the MOAT experiment. 

In your own words, what was the primary hypothesis that the experiment sought to test? To answer this, write down the design of the MOAT task in its most basic form: what was the independent variable? What about the dependent variable? Does this design let us test our hypothesis? Why or why not? 

What are some other, secondary hypotheses that we could test with this design if we wanted? 

## Expressing the hypothesis as a model 

Choose one of the hypotheses you wrote down above (you can choose the primary hypothesis if you'd like).

### Checking our assumptions

One thing model comparison helps us be more precise about is our assumptions. Can you think of any assumptions you have made when formulating your hypothesis? 

### Writing down the model 

At this point, you should have a sharp hypothesis that you want to test, expressed in words. How can we translate that in math? 

*Hint*: think about the structure of probe trials in the task. What choices do participants have to make on that trial? How would you write down what each choice is worth as a mathematical expression? How does your hypothesis map onto the inputs, outputs and parameters of that mathematical expression?
